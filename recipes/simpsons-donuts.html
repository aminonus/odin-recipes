    <p>
      I hope you will get to celebrate America’s favourite animated family by
      making these amazing LARD LAD Simpsons doughnuts! I made these in time to
      watch The Simpsons marathon last month, but honestly, do you really need
      an excuse to have these any other time of the year?
    </p>
    <p>
      A beautiful dough that’s not too sweet or oily, soft and airy inside and a
      bright beautiful glaze on top! Yep, that my friends is the perfect
      doughnut. So naturally, I had to replicate this at home with my own recipe
      for simpsons doughnuts.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Dough for Doughnuts</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>500 g / 17.6 oz of AP flour</li>
      <li>½ cup 120mL lukewarm water</li>
      <li>½ cup 120mL lukewarm milk</li>
      <li>1 tbsp yeast <em>instant dry</em></li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 large yolk</li>
      <li>4 tbsp sugar <em>¼ cup</em></li>
      <li>4 tbsp butter <em>softened</em></li>
      <li>Generous pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Glaze</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cups icing sugar or confectioner's sugar</li>
      <li>3 tbsp milk or water</li>
      <li>Pink colouring</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Set aside about ¼ cup of the flour, and place the rest of the flour in
        the mixing bowl with the sugar, milk, yeast mix, egg, yolk and salt.
        Leave the excess flour (¼ cup) aside in case you need it later. Mix on
        low speed with the paddle attachment or kneading hook in your mixer
        until the mix comes together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the softened butter (1/2 - 1 tbsp at a time) until it's all
        incorporated. Add some flour, if you need to get the dough off the sides
        of the bowl. Add the rest of the flour if needed to form a soft dough
        ball.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead the dough for about 5 - 7 minutes until you have a soft, shiny,
        slightly tacky dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the ball of dough in a lightly oiled bowl (with enough room to
        rise) and cover with plastic wrap. Remember to place the dough, with the
        seam side down.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the dough rise at room temperature (70-75°F) till it is has doubled
        in size - this should take about an hour, maybe less depending on how
        warm it is.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently release the air in the dough and refrigerate it overnight at this
        point. This helps develop the flavours of the dough better and it's is
        easier to handle when it is chilled as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        However you could roll out the dough and start cutting at this point if
        you wish. I recommend leaving it overnight (or at least a few hours) in
        the refrigerator.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next morning, take the dough out on to a floured surface and roll out
        the dough till it's about ½ inch thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut out 3-3.5 inch diameter doughnuts with a doughnut cutter - or use a
        large and small biscuit or cookie cutter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the doughnuts and doughnut holes on a parchment paper. Knead the
        left over doughnut dough lightly and let it rest for about 30 minutes,
        and repeat rolling and cutting once more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the cut doughnuts and doughnut holes with plastic wrap and let
        them rise for about 1 hour (see tips in the post to check if the
        doughnuts are proofed properly).
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a good amount of oil or shortening (the doughnut needs to float at
        least 2 inches above the bottom of the pan) in a heavy bottomed pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the oil is heated to 375°F - carefully drop in a doughnut. After 30
        - 45 seconds check to see if the doughnut has turned a golden brown. If
        it has, flip it over. If it hasn't leave it for a few seconds longer and
        then flip it over. The doughnut will darken as they cool, so be careful
        not to let it darken too much while frying.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer the doughnut on to a wire rack to let it cool.</li>
      <li>
        Dip one side in the pink glaze (or drizzle it over the top of the
        doughnuts), followed by rainbow sprinkles on top before the glaze sets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift the icing sugar and whisk in the milk or water, 1 tbsp at a time
        until you get a thick but pourable consistency. Add a couple of drops of
        pink colouring to get the desired colour.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3><em>and now enjoy</em></h3>
